# Forget Me Not
This is a small to-do application built in React which I actively develop to gain experience with the [React](https://www.react.dev) library. On the main page, Groups may be created, each which can contain their own set of to-do Tasks. The Groups and Tasks are saved between sessions using the local storage API.
